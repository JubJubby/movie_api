        <h1>Objective</h1>

        <p>
            To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
            application will provide users with access to information about different
            movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
            personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
        </p>
        <p>The APIs are made using RESTful architechture.</p>

            <br><li>/movies/movieName returns a movie's data by the movie's name using a GET request. <br>Use "%20" in place of a space. <br>Example: "/movies/Rat%20Race" will return: <br>Title: "Rat Race"<br>Director: "Jerry Zucker"<br>Genre: "Comedy"</li>
            <br><li>/movies/genre/genreName returns movies by the movies' genre using a GET request. <br>Use "%20" in place of a space. <br>Example: "/movies/genre/Horror" will return: <br>Title: "Donnie Darko"<br>Director: "Richard Kelly"<br>Genre: "Horror"</li>
            <br><li>/movies/directors/directorName returns director's data by name using a GET request. <br>Use "%20" in place of a space. <br>Example: "/movies/directors/Mel%20Brooks" will return: <br>Title: "Spaceballs"<br>Director: "Mel Brooks"<br>Genre: "Comedy"</li>
            <br><li>/users creates a new JSON object holding data about the user including an ID using a POST request. <br>Example:<br>ID: 1<br>Username: John Doe<br>Password: Password123!<br>email: jondoe@email.com<br>Birthday: 01-02-03<br>Favorite Movies: []</li>
            <br><li>/users/ID updates a user's information using a PUT request. <br>Example:<br>ID: 1<br>Username: Jon Doe<br>Password123!<br>email: jondoe@email.com<br>Birthday: 01-02-03<br>Favorite Movies: []</li>
            <br><li>/users/ID/movieName adds a movie to a user's favorites list using a POST request. This returns only a text saying that the movie has been added.</li>
            <br><li>/users/ID/movieName removes a movie from a user's favorites list using a DELETE request. This returns only a text saying that the movie has been removed.</li>
